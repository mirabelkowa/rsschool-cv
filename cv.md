## About me:
    I’ve been working as an HVAC designer for 8 years and I feel now that I’m not interested in this job anymore. My goal is to be a frontend developer because it’s interesting and gives many possibilities for self-realization.

## Skills and Proficiency:
* HTML5, CSS, SCSS
* JavaScript Basics
* Git, GitHub
* VS Code

## Code example:
    function f(num) {
        let res;
        let count = 0;
        while(true) {
            res = num;
            if (res < 10) {
                return count;
            }
            num = num / 2;
            count++;
        }
    }
